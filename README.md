# Welcome to this TDD TicTacToe!

![](../Snapshot TicTacToe.png)

This project was done with pleasure using create-react-app & typescript template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

To run unit tests of the app. I recommend you to use WallabyJs plugin if you want to make TDD (Test-Driven Development) and see
in real time, the failed tests.

### `npm run cypress`

This command will run Cypress. A next-gen tool that is well used for TDD. You will find e2e tests of the game and also component testing.
Component testing is the new way to make unit tests with Cypress. I did it with Jest & Cypress. 

After running this command, you will be at this screen :

You can choose what you want to run. Then you will see the tests running with the UI.
